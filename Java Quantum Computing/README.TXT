This project aims at creating a basic state vector quantum computer
simulator. What this means is that it creates an ideal quantum computer
that outputs the expected results from a circuit. This version only includes
2 types of gates, due to time constraint. In the future, I hope to finish
the CX gate and add rotations and phase gates.
